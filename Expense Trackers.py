#Project suggested by Grok to track expenses
#Create a program that tracks daily expenses, categorizes them, and provides
#basic insights(total spent, unique categories, or expenses above a threshold)
#lists: store expense entries
#Dictionaries: map expenses to categories and amounts
#set: find unique categories
#requirements:
#allow user to input expenses
#store expenses in a dictionary with categories as keys and lists of amounts as values
#provide options to view total spent accross all categories, list unique categories, show expenses above a user specified amount
